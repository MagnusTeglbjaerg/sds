Assignment 1 is now available on the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/abjer/sds/blob/master/material/assignments/assignment_1.ipynb). The hand-in will be on peergrade.io and deadline for handing on is Sunday before midnight Danish time. More info on accessing peergrade will follow on the intranet by Saturday noon.

The assignment must be handed in as a group. The format of the assignment must be Jupyter Notebook file (i.e. `.ipynb`).

Note that after the assignment we ask you to grade other groups assignments, this has to be done by midnight Monday. This should take at most one hour and be a good learning experience where you will also see our suggested solution.
